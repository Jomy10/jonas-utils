Jonas' Utils Java Library<br/>
[View the Docs](https://jomy10.github.io/jonas-utils/docs)

This library is a collection of classes that I created throughout my coding adventure. You are free to use this, though attribution
would be lovely. 
I just hope this can be useful for someone.
You can copy the dependency or download the library from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/be.jonaseveraert.utils/jonas-utils/1.0.4/jar).

The library contains classes for:
- Working with Wave audio files (creating, reading & writing)
- Compressing and decompressing zip-files
- Working with Word files (creating & writing)
- Array utils (inverting, repeating, taking a part, bytes to hexadecimal, string splitting)
- Image utils (getting image dimensions)
- An interface for a progress bar, which can also be passed to the WaveFileBuilder

Source code in the src folder

If you're using this library on **Android**, I advice you to use the 1.0.4 version instead of the 1.1 version.

This library is not being actively developped at the moment. Some of the classes might be recoded to Rust in the future
so it can be used across multiple programming languages.

I have archived this project as I do not actively develop it anymore, nor do I have any intent to use it in new projects or add to it in the future. I have simply moved on to other programming languages I enjoy more than Java and I don't have much use for Java anymore, other than Android applications. Feel free to still use the the library though!
