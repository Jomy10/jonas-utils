Jonas' Utils Java Library<br/>
[View the Docs](https://jomy10.github.io/jonas-utils/docs)

This library is a collection of classes that I created throughout my coding adventure. You are free to use this, though attribution
would be lovely. 
I just hope this can be useful for someone.
You can copy the dependency or download the library from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/be.jonaseveraert.utils/jonas-utils/1.0.4/jar).

Source code in the src folder

If you're using this library on **Android**, I advice you to use the 1.0.4 version instead of the 1.1 version.

This library is not being actively developped at the moment. Some of the classes might be recoded to Rust in the future
so it can be used across multiple programming languages.
