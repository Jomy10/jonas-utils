Jonas' Utils Java Library<br/>
[Docs](https://jomy10.github.io/jonas-utils/docs)

This library is a collection of classes that I created throughout my coding adventure. You are free to use this, though attribution
would be lovely. 
I just hope this can be useful for someone.
You can copy the dependency or download the library from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/be.jonaseveraert.utils/jonas-utils/1.0.4/jar).

Source code in the src folder

This library is not being actively developped at the moment.
